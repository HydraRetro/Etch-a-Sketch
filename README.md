# Developer Log

Day 1:
- Created repository for project.
- Created HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- Added basic h1 and reset button to HTML.
- Added function to make reset button refresh whole page.
- Basic CSS for HTML.
- Added Github link with tiny SVG icon.
- Made default 16x16 grid.
- Made function that turns the div cells black on mouseover
  but its only changing the first one. I think I need a loop?
- Added 3 buttons for grid sizes
- Created temp function on button click to change DOM html & style to all 3 sizes
- Left default 16x16 in as well for now.

Day 2:
- Figured out how to make it work for the default but doesnt work once I change the grid size.
- Passed in the mouseover function into each of the button event listeners and works that way.
- Trying to figure out a way to clear the grid once a button is pushed..no luck yet.

Day 3:
- Refactoring code
- Changed buttons to be color select and erase.
- Added input per the Odin project requests.
